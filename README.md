# Donation Campaign

## Project features

Here are some key features of my project:

1. Category-specific Details:

    * Users can click on different categories to view detailed information about the campaigns within that category.
    * Each category page displays relevant campaign descriptions, images, videos, and progress towards the campaign goal.

2. Donation Tracking:

    * A personalized donation history section for users to view a record of their contributions, categorized by the campaigns they've supported.


3. Personalized Donation Pie Chart:

    * In the user's profile or dashboard, a graphical representation (e.g., pie chart) of their donations, illustrating how their contributions are distributed across different categories or campaigns.


4. Mobile Responsiveness:

    * A mobile-friendly design to ensure a seamless experience for users accessing the website on smartphones and tablets.


5. Search Functionality:

    * A search bar to help users quickly find specific campaigns or causes they are interested in supporting.

These features will enhance the user experience, encourage more donations, and provide transparency and engagement for your donation campaign website with multiple categories.
